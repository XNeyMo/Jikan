			<h1 class="text-3xl">Hi There, ðŸ‘‹</h1>

			<p>I'm <span class="text-amethyst-500">Neyan Montes</span>, also known as XNeyMo, and I'm a frontend developer passionate about the design and construction of websites and web applications, as well as software.</p>

			<p>In my university studies I've always had the possibility of creating my own schedules taking into account the subjects and courses available.</p>

			<p>However, since there are so many options, I've always thought that, perhaps, the schedule I chose is not the most optimal, that is why, in my last semesters I made an Excel with all the possibilities and saw which one was the best for me.</p>

			<p>Until, as a programmer, I decided to create an algorithm to find the best possible schedule, that schedule that I call "perfect" since I didn't spend much time at university.</p>

			<p>I presented this project to my friends and they told me to post it so I could help more college students who are in the same situation, who aren't sure if the schedule they created is really the best one out there.</p>

			<p>I will update this project with more features that I have in mind for the future, such as:</p>

			<ul class="list-disc pl-14">
				<li>Schedule without much space between classes</li>
				<li>Schedule with fewer possible days</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I hope my project is useful to you.</p>
